This is just a small game written with [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss][gloss]] to steer a serpens through a maze. Mainly a sandbox for me to play with.

* To Do

- Switch from =Picture= to a =Pixure= type that’s probably =IntPoint → PixureElement=, where =IntPoint= signifies the window size.
  - Can we implement combinators like “besides” and “above” using that approach?
- Adapt the bitmap font to use Pixure
